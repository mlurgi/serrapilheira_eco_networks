Human disturbance has caused, and will continue to cause, profound impacts on all ecosystems across the world. Taken together, the effects that human impact have started to cause what has been called the 6th Mass Extinction, which we are currently witnessing. This mass extinction is comparable to previous mass extinction events such as the Cretaceous-Paleogene, in the sense that by different estimates the extinction rate of specie is currently [between 100–1,000 times greater than the background extinctions rate](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12816). 

These impacts have translated, among other things, into a fundamental reorganisation of biodiversity across spatial and temporal scales. The main drivers of this anthropogenically-derived global change on biodiversity modification include: habitat loss and fragmentation, global warming, biological invasions, among others. In order to design sound conservation policies and strategies to mitigate these impacts on biodiversity, as well as to fully understand their effects on ecosystems we need predictive theory that allow us to link ecological mechanisms to ecosystem organisation and responses to change.

## 3.1 Warming
Warming has prompted a series of responses from species. Three main universal responses to warming have been identified across species and taxonomic groups.

### Range shifts

In an attempt to track their ideal climatic conditions (i.e. to maximise fitness) species have shifted their geographical distribution ranges polewards latitudinally, and towards higher elevations altitudinally. Even though responses vary among species, this aspect of biodiversity reorganisation is more or less universal.

Given this, current research has focused on identifying potential universal drivers of species range shifts that might improve our predictive ability of species range shifts. Recent efforts to understand the determinants of differential shifts across bird species in the UK have revealed that both land cover and climate both differentially affect species that are more distributed towards the north vs more southernly species.

The first step in the analysis of range shifts is quantifying the actual shifts:

### Body size

A second universal response to climate change is changes on body size. Both within species and the distribution of body sizes across species within communities. This response can be linked to three classical ecological hypotheses relating temperature to body size.

1.- **[Bergmann's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergmann%27s_rule)** states that species and organisms or larger sizes tend to be found in colder environments, while small-sized species and organisms tend to inhabit warmer regions.

2.- **James' rule** states that within the same species, populations of smaller-sized individuals would be found in the warmest parts of the species' range.

3.- **The temperature size rule** stating that individual body size (in ectotherms) decreases with increasing temperature.

Taken together, these three rules can help us generate hypotheses on the potential effects of warming on natural communities. In particular, it would be expected (and it has been demonstrated in natural populations), that both individuals within species (by reaching maturity earlier) are becoming smaller in general, and the body size distributions of species within communities are being shifted towards smaller values. This has profound consequences for the networks of ecological interactions between species.
