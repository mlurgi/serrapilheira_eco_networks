# Ecological Networks at the Serrapilheira Training Program in Quantitative Biology and Ecology

This website was created to deliver the ecological networks component of the "Community Ecology and Biodiversity" module of the 2022 edition of the Serrapilheira Training Program in Quantitative Biology and Ecology

https://www.ictp-saifr.org/qbioprogram/

I compiled material relevant to the structural analysis and dynamical modelling of complex networks involving species and ecological interactions (or other ecologically relevant relationships)
