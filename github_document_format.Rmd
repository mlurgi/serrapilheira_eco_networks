## Overview

The GitHub document format generates GitHub compatible markdown (.md) files which are subsequently rendered to HTML when viewed on GitHub. The `keep_md` option of the HTML document format has traditionally been used for creating GitHub documents, however the `github_document` format has several advantages:

- Use of full Pandoc markdown (e.g. citations) which is converted to GitHub markdown.
- A local HTML preview (using CSS based on GitHub) is available for the document.
- When using RStudio the local HTML preview is written to a temporary directory (and so won't be checked in or require a .gitignore).
- Optional generation of a table of contents from section headings.
- Support for including shared header and/or footer content.

To create a GitHub document from R Markdown you specify the `github_document` output format in the front-matter of your document:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: github_document
    ---

### Installation

The `github_document` format is currently only available within a very recent version of the **rmarkdown** package. You can install this version as follows:

```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Installing the [current release of RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (v0.99.879 or higher) is also highly recommended as it includes support for local HTML preview of documents using GitHub CSS.

## HTML Preview

By default when you render a GitHub document markdown file (.md) an HTML preview file (.html) is also written so you can see what the document will look like when it is rendered on GitHub. 

When you call `rmarkdown::render` directly from the command line the preview file is written alongside the generated .md file. However, when you render from within RStudio using the **Knit** button the preview HTML is written to a temporary directory and then automatically displayed by RStudio.

You can suppress the creation of preview HTML using the `html_preview` option. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      github_document:
        html_preview: false
    ---


## Table of Contents

You can add a table of contents using the `toc` option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the `toc_depth` option. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      github_document:
        toc: true
        toc_depth: 2
    ---

If the table of contents depth isn't explicitly specified then it defaults to 3 (meaning that all level 1, 2, and 3 headers will be included in the table of contents).

## Figure Options

The `fig_width` and  `fig_height` options can be used to control the default figure width and height (7x5 is used if values are not explicitly specified). The `dev` option controls which graphics device is used for output (the default is "png") For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      github_document:
        fig_width: 5
        fig_height: 5
        dev: jpeg
    ---

## Includes

You can do more advanced customization of output by including additional content. To include content in the document header or before/after the document body you use the `includes` option as follows:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      github_document:
        includes:
          in_header: header.md
          before_body: doc_prefix.md
          after_body: doc_suffix.md
    ---


## Markdown Extensions

By default R Markdown is defined as all pandoc markdown extensions with the following tweaks for backward compatibility with the markdown package:

```
+autolink_bare_uris
+ascii_identifier
+tex_math_single_backslash
```

You can enable or disable markdown extensions using the `md_extensions` option (you preface an option with `-` to disable and `+` to enable it). For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      github_document:
        md_extensions: -autolink_bare_uris+hard_line_breaks
    ---

The above would disable the `autolink_bare_uris` extension and enable the `hard_line_breaks` extension. 

For more on available markdown extensions see the [pandoc markdown specification](http://pandoc.org/README.html#pandocs-markdown).


## Pandoc Arguments

If there are pandoc features you want to use that lack equivalents in the YAML options described above you can still use them by passing custom `pandoc_args`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      github_document:
        pandoc_args: [
          "--filter", "/opt/local/filters/myfilter"
        ]
    ---

Documentation on all available pandoc arguments can be found in the [pandoc user guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#options).

## Shared Options

If you want to specify a set of default options to be shared by multiple documents within a directory you can include a file named `_output.yaml` within the directory. Note that no YAML delimiters or enclosing output object are used in this file. For example:

**\_output.yaml**

```yaml
github_document:
  fig_width: 5
  fig_height: 5
```

All documents located in the same directory as `_output.yaml` will inherit its options. Options defined explicitly within documents will override those specified in the shared options file.
